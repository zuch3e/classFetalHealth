# Simple classification of Fetal Health using RFC, SVM and LogReg
## Project for the Machine Learning course
This is a simple project which aims to compare RandomForestClassifier, SuportVectorMachine and LogisticRegression in order to see the results in the classification of Fetal Health based on the results of a Cardiotocogram

I have compared the results for the preprocessed data and the data without any preprocessing using different test/train ratios from the [dataset](https://github.com/zuch3e/classFetalHealth/blob/main/fetal_health.csv):

The comparison between RFC, SVM, LogReg can be seen in the [comparison file](https://github.com/zuch3e/classFetalHealth/blob/main/comparison.txt)

The dataset has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification/)
